// while loop checks the condition and then performs the function, Whereas 
// Do while loop first run the "Do" condition and then checks the "While" condition.

// Meaning in a "Do while Loop" the condition is checked later when the "Do" loop has been executed 
// Whereas in "while" the condition is checked first.

//syntax  While

while(condition){
    // code goes here 
    i++
}


// syntax Do While 

do{
    // code goes here
}
while(condition)
{
    // code goes here
}


// NOTE IN "DO WHILE" THE CODE WILL RUN ATLEAST ONCE.

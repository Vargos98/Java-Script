// Javascript is a dynamically typed language meaning every data type is checked during runtime 
//(not before)
// for example : 

var a = 1
var sr = 'hi'
var b = true
var f = 15.50
 console.log(a,sr,b,f)

 // NOTE: Languages like (Java,c++, c ) require their datatypes to be defined earlier and they are
 // checked before runtime and if any datatype doesnt match it throws an error.
